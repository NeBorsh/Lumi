> ```Basically, I have no idea what to call it. If you suddenly become aware of this repository and you need to mention it somewhere, you can name it as “Under-cryptocurrency Lum”```

> ```It’s hard for me to tell what prompted me to put this project out to the public, most likely this is an unsuccessful experiment of a beginner. Maybe this code will help someone, if so, please don't be stingy and put an asterisk, so you can tell me that my strength is not in vain. In general, with regards to the design of the project, I'll apologize in advance, I'm very bad at working with the git system...```

### ⊱⋅ ──────────────── `A little bit about yourself 🪝` ───────────────── ⋅⊰
> ```In general, I'm a beginner, before that I seriously worked only with lua (as a result, 2 years in the trash, because it was fun), but I decided to switch to another, more flexible programming language (python), each repository in my profile is, in fact, a small experiment in which I'm just trying to show my progress in learning the language, possibly helping newcomers like me in the future. In general, as mentioned above, I have little experience with the git system, as well as working in a team of people. If you have any questions, you can write to me at discord: Borsh#8888```
